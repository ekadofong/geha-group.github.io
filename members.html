                    Marla Geha is a professor and astrophysicist at Yale University. She obtained a B.S. in Applied and 
                    Engineering Physics from Cornell University in 1995 and her PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from 
                    University of California Santa Cruz in 2003. She was awarded a Hubble Postdoctoral Fellowship by the 
                    Space Telescope Science Institute, which she took to the Carnegie Observatories. She arrived at 
                    Yale in 2008 as an Assistant Professor, and was promoted to the rank of full Professor in 2014.
                    She has received honors including an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, a John S. Guggenheim Fellowship 
                    and the Dylan Hixon '88 Prize for teaching excellence in the natural sciences at Yale. 

                    Geha utilizes the world’s largest telescopes to study the smallest galaxies in the Universe. 
                    Her research is focused on understanding how the least luminous known galaxies formed, and 
                    sing these galaxies to understand the nature of dark matter and the underlying cosmology of the Universe.
                    
                    Throughout her career, Geha has been involved in promoting the public understanding of science 
                    through observatory open days, public lectures and school visits. Geha is on the board of the 
                    Warrior-Scholar Project, a two-week summer boot camp for returning United States military veterans, 
                    and she runs the REVU summer research program for student veterans. Geha has received various honors  
                    including Popular Science magazine’s “Brilliant 10″ young scientists in the country (2009). 
                    Between 2012-2014, she was a Kavli Frontiers of Science Fellow, 
                    participating and organizing sessions for the yearly U.S. Kavli Frontiers of Science meeting 
                    hosted by the National Academy of Science. Geha’s science has been featured in popular articles
                     published including Time Magazine, CNN, The Daily Mail and the John F. Kennedy Legacy Gallery.
